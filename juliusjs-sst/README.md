# Speech to Text with JuliusJS
* JuliusJS project: https://github.com/zzmp/juliusjs

Requires:
* **To run in a web server** AKA at least in localhost
* Web Workers http://caniuse.com/#search=web%20workers
* Web Audio API http://caniuse.com/#search=audio%20api

## Background
"Julius" is a high-performance, two-pass large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR)
decoder software for speech-related researchers and developers.

## Compile you own vocabulary
In Julius, a recognition grammar is separated into two files:

 1. The ".voca" file which defines each word pronunciation. This information comes from an Acoutic Model that contains a statistical representation of each distinct sound that makes up a spoken word.

 2. The ".grammar" file which defines the Grammar that the Speech Recognition Engine (SRE) can expect as input.

Both the .grammar and .voca files should be compiled into ".dfa"Â  and ".dict" files so that Julius can use them.

The VoxForge-project is working on the creation of an open-source acoustic model for the English language in Julius.
